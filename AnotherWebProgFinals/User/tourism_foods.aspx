                <p class="center">Gentri’s Best is a local producer of kasilyo, the native kesong puti (white cheese) of Cavite made from carabao’s milk. Best served with pandesal and coffee, kasilyo has a soft, smooth texture with hints of sour and salty flavors.</p>
                <p class="center">Each palm-sized, round piece is handmade. Milk, mixed with vinegar, is boiled and stirred until it thickens. The congealed mixture is then shaped into a ball and soaked in brine until it’s ready for packaging. Gentri’s Best also makes another variety of kesong puti with no vinegar, which gives it a milder taste. Their other products include fresh milk, yoghurt, ice cream, and pastillas de leche.</p>
                <p class="center">Established as a cooperative in 2005, Gentri’s Best operates a medium scale processing center and collects a daily average of 250 liters of carabao’s milk from local raisers. Their products are sold in their own store in General Trias and distributed through Mr. Moo’s dairy stores.</p>

                <p class="center">Arroz Valenciana or Arroz ala Valenciana is a Spanish rice dish considered as a peasant meal during the Spanish-colonization of the Philippines. Its made of glutinous rice and saffron mixed w/ left-over meat and vegetables and  prepared for farmers before they head out to the fields, helping sustain their energy as they tend to their farm. </p>
                <p class="center">Arroz Valenciana is served during holidays and special occasions. Since it is only a few days before Christmas, I am featuring this dish so that you can have more options for your family’s Noche Buena or Christmas parties. This is also a perfect dish to serve during New Year’s eve dinner.</p>
                <p class="center">But in General Trias, Valenciana can be bought and eaten even if it's not holiday season.</p>
